No Twitter X extension, made by CyberKevin
v1.0.0 - 24/07/2023 13:43

This extension just try to get the X graphics logo data, and replace it with old twitter graphics data.
To avoid spamming the page, we stop trying after we think all graphics have been replaced.
So if we missed something, we will update it.

PLEASE ONLY USE THIS EXTENSION IN THE WAIT FOR A BETTER SOLUTION, IT'S JUST A FASTLY MADE ONE TO PATCH IT UP AS FAST AS POSSIBLE
